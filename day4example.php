    <p>In the field of <?php echo $repeat; ?>, technological innovation is used to aid people with disabilities. <?php echo $repeat; ?> deals with prosthetics, robotics and physical therapy.</p>
    <p>In the United States of America, <?php echo $repeat; ?> is currently taught at a very small number of schools including, but not limited to, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Chicago. This is due, in part, to its being a relatively recent field of study.</p>
    <p>Hugh Herr, a professor at MIT, pioneered much of the technology within the MIT media labs themselves. However, because the demand for <?php echo $repeat; ?> is peaking, <?php echo $repeat; ?> is slowly being implemented into other schools and departments. The collaboration between Carnegie Melon and North Carolina State researchers on an exoskeleton is just one example of this. Overall, <?php echo $repeat; ?> is a fascinating area of research.</p>
